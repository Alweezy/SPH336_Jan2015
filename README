A bare minimum implementation for the Freescale Tower KIT as a starting point for Embedded Lab
Implemented:
-> 4 LEDs 
-> one button interrupt
-> a serial port (UART5) through the osbdm port to the PC

To do:
make and program the kit with the .elf file generated:
one one terminal run this command:
openocd -c "interface osbdm" -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/boards/twr-k60n512.cfg

on another terminal, run the foloowing commands:
arm-none-eabi-gdb
(gdb) cd /path-to-your-repo/
(gdb) make
(gdb) target remote localhost:3333
(gdb) monitor reset halt
(gdb) file out/k60_gpio_demo.elf
(gdb) load
(gdb) monitor reset init
(gdb) c

You should see two blinking LEDs and on pressing button SW1, the other two should toggle and send a string to a PC terminal
To open the PC serial terminal, run the following commands:

sudo apt-get install gtk-term
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM*
gtk-term

On Gtk-term, go to Configuration->Port menu and select the following settings:
Port: ttyACM0
Baud Rate: 38400
Parity: None
Bits: 8
Stopbits:1
Flow control: none

Next, modify the program so that:
whenever a number character is sent from the computer keyboard (0-9), the binary equivalent is displayed on the 4 LEDs(E1 is MSB)

Next, choose one peripheral amongs [TSI(LED touchpads), USB, ADC(On-board Potentiometer), UART!=UART5 or ETH(Ethernet)] and configure it to work
Clearly describe and illustrate your tests

Good luck.
