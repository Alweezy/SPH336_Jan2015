// configuring UART2
Connect the tower kit to the computer through a USB port.
Make sure that you have the  processor expert project we have been using for the previous projects.
Ensure that the perspective open is the C/C++.
Then on processor expert components  navigate to >>CPU internal peripherals.
							>>communication
							>>Asynchroserial
then rightclick on Asyncroserial and select add components.
You have to set the device to UART2
Then got to RxD and select [!] PTD2/SPI0_SOUT/UART2_RX/FB_AD4
And on TxD select [!] PTD3/SPI0_SIN/UART2_TX/FB_AD3
Thenclick generate code.
Ensure that your BITIO is confugured then debug the code
